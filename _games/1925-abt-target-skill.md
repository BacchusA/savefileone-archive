## Exhibit Placard
Target Skill represents the “before electronics” era where arcades still trained aim, timing, and consistency—just with simpler mechanisms. Even without a video screen, it’s part of the lineage that normalized coin-op shooting play as a repeatable skill test.

## Mechanics Snapshot
- Controls: aim + trigger
- Objective: score hits reliably
- Skill focus: consistency + rhythm + precision
