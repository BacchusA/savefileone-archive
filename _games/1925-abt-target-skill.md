## Exhibit Placard
Target Skill is a coin-operated electromechanical game developed and manufactured by A.B.T. Manufacturing Co. and first released in 1925. It’s a one-player countertop arcade shooter: the player inserts a penny and uses a fixed pistol to shoot five steel balls at a set of targets. Each successful hit drops a flag over the target, with no reward except the satisfaction of hitting all five. Target Skill’s historical importance lies in its role as one of the earliest popular skill-based arcade games, steering coin-op amusements away from gambling devices toward true games. Unencumbered by payout mechanisms or chance, it demonstrated that pure hand-eye coordination challenges could captivate the public and be profitable. Its unique contributions include the introduction of multi-shot play per coin (5 shots for 1¢ was a new idea in 1925), an intuitive hit-feedback system (the dropping flags), and an overall design that proved arcade games could be entertaining purely for the gameplay itself – effectively making it a forerunner of pinball and video arcade games in concept. Target Skill was hugely successful in its time, with tens of thousands sold, and it spawned numerous variants and imitations. It remains a landmark in arcade history for establishing the target shooting genre and popularizing skill-focused coin-ops on a large scale.

## Historical Significance
Target Skill is often cited as “one of the most important coin-operated machines of the 1920s”. It proved that a game could attract players on the basis of skill and fun alone, without payouts or elaborate themes. By focusing on quick, repeatable skill gameplay, it paved the way for the modern concept of an arcade game rather than a mere novelty or vending machine. It also standardized many design features (coined-triggered multi-shot mechanisms, safe enclosed projectiles, score indicators) that became staples of arcade shooters. In essence, Target Skill’s legacy is that it helped coin-op amusements “move from novelties and gambling concepts to actual games”, heralding the coming golden age of pinball and arcade entertainment.

## Core Design Influences
### From penny-as-bullet to cabinet marksmanship ritual
Long before countertop guns became common, inventors were already chasing a simple thrill: pay a coin, take a shot, prove your aim. The 1890s Automatic Shooting Range by Scottish Inventions Company famously used the player’s inserted penny as the projectile inside a glass-front case—an early “pure amusement” coin-op. In the U.S., Automatic Target Machine Company of New York pushed gun-style trade stimulators by the 1890s. A few years later, the Electric Rifle experimented with electrical alignment feedback, while machines like the Autarm Automatic Target Pistol refined the enclosed, safe “practice range” cabinet.

## Technical Innovations
### Five shots per penny—engineered, not lucked into
A.B.T. Manufacturing Co. didn’t just build another countertop shooter—it optimized the entire transaction. A hardened coin chute forced a real coin down a ramp to trigger play, resisting slugs and misfires. The star advance came from Walter Tratsch: a spring-loaded pistol paired with a gravity-fed magazine of steel balls, automatically cycling “ammo” between shots. That engineering shift let one coin buy a burst of play—Target Skill’s 5 shots for 1¢ after the company’s move to Chicago. Inside the oak case, five target holes and flipping flags delivered clear hit feedback. No payout hardware wasn’t a missing feature—it was a legal strategy.

## Aesthetic, Thematic, and Narrative Lineage
### A carnival gallery shrunk into a wooden box
Target Skill’s “story” is mostly implied: you are the marksman, the cabinet is your range, the flags are your proof. It miniaturizes the midway shooting gallery into a countertop ritual—glass front, fixed pistol, satisfying mechanical click, and targets that visibly react. The original theme stays abstract (holes, flags, precision), but the format proved so adaptable that variants could drape new fantasies over the same chassis. Big Game Hunter leaned into 1920s safari fascination by adding animal imagery and a more overt “hunt” vibe. The cultural fuel underneath is older: public obsession with sharpshooting from exhibitions like Buffalo Bill's Wild West, where aim was spectacle and identity.

## Genre Codification and Structural Influence
### The arcade skill-loop blueprint, finally standardized
Target Skill lands at a turning point: not the first coin-op shooter, but a model that made the “skill target shooter” feel like a modern product category. Its structure is clean: insert coin, receive a set number of attempts, chase a perfect clear by dropping every flag. No external reward is required—the score state is the prize. That helped separate games from gambling hardware, and it established a template later reused across arcades: short session, immediate feedback, repeatable mastery. Its success also sparked direct genre neighbors. International Mutoscope answered with Shootoscope, echoing the same compact, quick-play challenge logic.

## Community, Cultural, and Ecosystem Impact
### A penny game that helped legitimize arcades
In 1925, Target Skill arrived as public leisure was accelerating—and it scaled fast. The breakdown reports production surging to thousands per month and tens of thousands over its first decade, placing cabinets in boardwalk arcades, soda shops, hotel lobbies, and corner stores. The real ecosystem shift was legal and social: by avoiding payouts, target shooters faced fewer restrictions than gambling devices, letting operators run them openly as “games of skill.” That visibility helped reframe arcades as competitive play spaces instead of slot-machine shadows. The design ripple carried forward: later gun amusements—like Seeburg's Ray-O-Lite and moving-target ranges such as Exhibit's Automatic Pistol Range—follow the same crowded-around-the-cabinet social energy. Historian Keith Smith is cited noting the genre’s real popularity surge in the 1920s.

## Curator's Note
Target Skill isn’t a single invention—it’s a careful synthesis: reliable coin handling, repeatable multi-shot play, and unmistakable “you hit it” feedback. That blend helped move coin-ops from coin-fed curiosities and gray-area gambling toward honest, repeatable skill games—setting the tempo for the arcade century that followed.

## Highlights
The development story of Target Skill is intertwined with the career of Walter Tratsch, who had decades of coin-op experience by 1925. After Target Skill’s runaway success, A.B.T. Manufacturing continued to capitalize on the design for many years. The company released numerous models and themes (Model A through F and others) and by the early 1960s had built over 300,000 units of Target Skill and its variants, a testament to its enduring appeal. Tratsch and A.B.T. thereby enjoyed a long arc as a leading maker of coin-op gun games, and their spring-pistol mechanism became a de-facto standard licensed or copied by others. An interesting note is that International Mutoscope’s founder, William Rabkin, claimed independent inspiration for his 1926 Shootoscope, yet the striking similarity to Target Skill suggests a case of rapid iteration in the industry rather than wholly separate invention. This kind of parallel development sometimes leads to disputed credit: in arcade lore, A.B.T.’s Target Skill is generally recognized as the first blockbuster multi-shot target game, but Mutoscope’s Shootoscope (coming a year later) shows how quickly competitors jumped on the idea.

There’s also a lineage connection to pinball often discussed by historians: Target Skill’s concept of shooting balls at targets for points (with no payout) is seen as a cousin to early pinball (which launched a few years later with balls, pins, and scoring but no payout). Some speculate that the success of Target Skill in arcades gave entrepreneurs like Raymond Maloney (Bally) confidence that a purely fun-for-play machine could earn money – thus indirectly influencing the creation of pinball games in 1931. While pinball evolved from bagatelle and other ball-roll games, the arcade acceptance of Target Skill surely helped validate the market for non-gambling amusement machines.

In terms of developer legacy, A.B.T. Manufacturing eventually shifted focus or closed by the mid-20th century (their production of target games tapered off in the 1960s as electronic games took over). But their influence echoes in later companies that made gun games (Exhibit Supply, Seeburg, Midway, etc.), many of which can trace design DNA back to that little oak box from 1925. Walter Tratsch’s contribution is sometimes overlooked in mainstream game histories, but in Save File One we highlight him as a key figure who helped shape interactive entertainment long before video games – his Target Skill design proved that gameplay could be the central draw, an idea that is truly the bedrock of all video gaming to come.
