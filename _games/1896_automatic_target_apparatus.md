## Exhibit Placard
Step right up and test your aim! The Autarm Automatic Target Pistol brought the thrill of the Wild West shooting gallery into the age of machinery. This 1900 coin-op game let players fire a faux pistol at a bull’s-eye and instantly know if they hit their mark – no bullets required. It was a trailblazer in interactive entertainment, proving that mechanical technology could simulate real-world skills. In the evolutionary “Save File” of gaming history, Autarm earns a spot as a critical checkpoint between 19th-century carnival games and the electronic shooters of the 20th century. It matters because it showed early on how we could blend play with engineering: the Autarm pistol is essentially a mechanical ancestor to Duck Hunt and Time Crisis, teaching designers how to capture the essence of shooting within a machine. For the first time, players could engage in a virtual marksmanship challenge – a concept that would echo throughout arcade halls for the next century.

## Historical Significance
Autarm is one of the earliest interactive “video game” ancestors – a proto-light-gun arcade game that pioneered safe, automated target shooting. It demonstrated novel concepts like using electrical circuits to register an aim and provided a blueprint for later arcade shooting games. Only a handful were ever made, making it extremely rare, but its design influenced decades of coin-op marksmanship games.

## Core Design Influences - A shooting gallery without bullets—or broken glass
Autarm grows out of a late-1800s boom in public marksmanship culture: carnival shooting galleries, penny arcades, and trade stimulators that turned aim into spectacle. Early coin-op shooters like the Automatic Shooter and Electra Automatic Shooting Machine simply added coins to real projectiles, then wrestled with safety limits—enclosed cabinets, restricted gun travel, and constant maintenance. Autarm’s direct design ancestor is John L. McCullough’s 1896 “target apparatus” patent, described here as the first known electric arcade gun game. That template replaces pellets with electrical contacts: aim a fixed pistol, pull the trigger, and let the machine register hit or miss electronically. Autarm is the safer commercialization of that idea.

## Technical Innovations - A wiper contact “reads” your aim like machinery
Autarm’s magic trick is measurement. The pistol sits on a pedestal with a ball-and-socket joint, letting players aim in azimuth and elevation. Inside, a wiper blade sweeps a circular contact plate, tracking the gun’s angle as a physical electrical position. Pull the trigger and—if alignment matches a scoring zone—the circuit closes, triggering bell rings or indicator flags at the target. No projectile, no gunpowder, no pellets to clear. Advertisements stressed it was “complete in itself” with “no electric connections,” implying internal batteries rather than wall power. Springs, hammer action, linkages, and electromagnets turn a trigger pull into an electrical “shot”—an early simulation mechanism. The same contact-aiming concept is later noted as reappearing in the 1940s “Dale Gun” lineage.

## Aesthetic, Thematic, and Narrative Lineage - Wild West fantasy, dressed as “bull’s-eye” sport
Autarm leans hard into turn-of-the-century gun romance: sharpshooters, soldiers, and dime-novel bravado. The breakdown ties its cultural oxygen to Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows and the era’s appetite for safe vicarious shooting. The machine offers a revolver-style prop and a formal bull’s-eye target, shifting the mood from carnival whimsy toward “practice” and precision—ad copy even moralizes: “EVERY AIM IN LIFE SHOULD BE FOR THE BULL’S EYE.” Visually it’s described as a large floor cabinet with a high-mounted pistol, reportedly painted fire-engine red by modern collectors, designed to grab attention in parlors, saloons, and resorts. No plot, but a clear role: you are the lone crack shot.

## Genre Codification and Structural Influence - Aim, fire, feedback—an arcade loop becomes autonomous
Autarm helps define a machine-native shooting game: gun interface, target zone, and automated feedback with no attendant required. Earlier galleries needed human callouts or physical gongs struck by pellets. Autarm’s structural shift is electronic hit detection—your aim closes circuits, and the cabinet responds with bells or visible markers. It doesn’t track a running score or necessarily dispense prizes, but it proves a coin-op can host a complete marksmanship contest on its own. The breakdown frames it as a direct ancestor to later electromechanical light-sensing shooters, especially the Ray-O-Lite family, and draws a long arc toward later video light-gun experiences. Even where the tech changes, the skeleton remains: short turns, immediate results, bragging rights.

## Community, Cultural, and Ecosystem Impact  -Rare machine, loud idea: simulation sells
Autarm wasn’t a mass-market juggernaut in this breakdown—it’s described as produced in very limited numbers, with collector accounts noting only a handful of survivors. But its ecosystem role punches above its footprint. Marketed as a cent-operated attraction for public venues, it sits at the dawn of coin-op interactivity: an electrical firm, Splitdorf Laboratory, building an unusually complex amusement for the Automatic Target Machine Company. The impact is conceptual and contagious: it demonstrates that automated, self-scoring skill play can “fill a public demand” without live targets or attendants, and the breakdown notes competitors quickly advertising similar automatic pistol machines. Its bigger legacy is a design argument: simulation itself can be entertainment—an early stepping stone toward later arcades built around imitation and mastery.

## Curator's Note
Autarm replaces the messy reality of pellets with the clean logic of circuits: aim becomes a measurable position, and the “shot” becomes an electrical event. That single swap—simulation over impact—connects its influences, its engineering, its Wild West styling, and its long genre afterlife in arcade shooters built on instant feedback and repeatable skill.

## Highlights
Rarity and Rediscovery: Only three Autarm machines are known to exist today, making it a white whale for collectors. One example, restored in vivid red paint, fetched nearly $200,000 at a 2016 auction – a testament to its historical value. As a result, Autarm is often cited in antique coin-op circles as a “holy grail” piece. Its scarcity is partly because it was produced in low volume and because the few that operated likely wore out or were scrapped as newer games came along.

Name Origin: The moniker “Autarm” was likely derived from “Automatic Target Machine” (the name of the company). Some speculate it could be a contraction of “AUTomatic ARM” (i.e. automatic gun) – a fitting name for a self-operating firearm game. It’s pronounced how it looks: “Aut-arm.” The company’s full name, Automatic Target Machine Co., is emblazoned in its 1905 ads and emphasizes the mechanized nature of the device.

Gameplay and Operation: How was Autarm actually played? A patron would drop a penny into the slot, which would cock the internal mechanism and likely give a single shot (or possibly a short time window to shoot multiple times – details are scant). The player would aim the fixed-position pistol down the cabinet toward the target. Upon pulling the trigger, if the player’s aim was true, a hidden indicator flag would flip up on the target or a bell would ring, signaling a hit. The machine did not dispense prizes; the reward was largely the satisfaction (and bragging rights) of hitting the bull’s-eye. Ads boasted it “can be fired as fast as aim is taken” and “nothing else like it on the market”, suggesting a quick reset and the ability for a skilled player to fire multiple shots quickly by inserting more coins in succession.

Historical Anecdote: In a 1905 issue of The Billboard, the Autarm Pistol was advertised with a catchy slogan: “Every aim in life should be for the bull’s eye.” The ad pitched the game to operators as a “wonderful money maker” that was “equally attractive in parlors, saloons and resorts.” This gives a colorful snapshot of how such games were seen in the early 20th century – not only as novelties for amusement, but as profitable investments for venue owners, and versatile enough to entertain both upscale parlor guests and barroom crowds.

Contested Firsts: Some historians debate what counts as the “first” arcade game. While Autarm is a strong candidate for the first interactive coin-op skill game, you’ll sometimes hear of earlier devices (e.g. a French coin-op shooting gallery from the 1890s, or even an 1870s English apparatus) as being first. Many of those were one-of-a-kind or did not achieve commercial distribution. Autarm’s significance is that it was part of a commercial effort to sell these machines widely (the company offered catalogs and took orders). It represents one of the earliest attempts to make a coin-operated game at scale, even if that scale by today’s standards was tiny.
