## Exhibit Placard
Before “electronics in games” became normal, photoelectric sensors were already proving that light could trigger real reactions—counting, detecting, switching, signaling. In coin-op entertainment, this becomes a core enabling technology: your input produces light, and the machine can detect it to award a hit, a score, or a reaction.

## Mechanics Snapshot
- What it does: detects light changes and triggers an electrical response
- Why it matters: makes “hit detection” possible without physical contact
