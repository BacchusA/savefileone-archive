## Exhibit Placard
Ray-O-Lite is the early “light gun” shooting gallery idea in a form people actually paid to play. Pull the trigger, a beam of light goes out; targets register a hit via light-sensitive detection. It’s a key stepping stone between purely mechanical shooting games and later electronic aim-and-fire experiences.

## Mechanics Snapshot
- Controls: gun aim + trigger
- Objective: hit moving targets consistently
- Skill focus: tracking + reaction + accuracy
