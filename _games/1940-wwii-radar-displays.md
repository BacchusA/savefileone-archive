## Exhibit Placard
WWII radar wasn’t a “game,” but it created a visual language: a glowing CRT, a sweep, and meaningful dots that demanded interpretation. That UI idea—**a live electronic display you actively read and react to**—is one of the clearest ancestors of early screen-based interaction. It’s a straight line from “plot and interpret” to “aim and play.”

## Mechanics Snapshot
- UI pattern: sweep + echoes/blips, readouts, plotting
- Why it matters: makes CRT screens feel interactive and actionable
