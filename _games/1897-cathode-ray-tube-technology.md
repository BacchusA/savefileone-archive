## Exhibit Placard
Without the cathode-ray tube, there are no video screens – and without screens, the story of video games cannot even begin. Braun’s humble green-glowing tube was originally meant for science, but it unwittingly enabled play: from oscilloscopes used in the first electronic tennis game to the television sets that would host the first home consoles. For roughly a hundred years after 1897, if you played a video game, you played it on CRT technology. This makes Braun’s invention a cornerstone of gaming history.

## Historical Significance
This technology is the origin point for electronic visual displays, which makes it a foundational “level 0” entry in video game history. Though not a game itself, the CRT is where the idea of an interactive electronic screen first became possible. It directly led to oscilloscopes and TV picture tubes – and thereby to the first video game experiments on those devices. In short, the CRT is the canvas on which the very first video games would be drawn.

## Core Design Influences
### Mechanical play taught screens how to feel interactive
Before a CRT ever glowed, play already had a rulebook: aim, act, see the result. Late-1800s shooting galleries and penny arcade amusements trained players to use a physical control—rifle, lever, plunger—to influence a visible target and chase a score. Bagatelle, a pinball ancestor, turned simple motion into measurable progress: launch, bounce, tally. Alongside that, optical showpieces like the magic lantern and kinetoscope proved that moving imagery could hold an audience, even when it wasn’t interactive. Cathode-ray tube technology doesn’t inherit “game rules” from electronics—it inherits them from the habits of mechanical play and visual spectacle: input plus immediate feedback.

## Technical Innovations
### Braun’s electron beam made motion a signal
Cathode-ray tube technology arrives through lab grit: evacuated glass, high voltage, and the discovery that “cathode rays” can excite a coated surface into light. Crookes tubes showed the beam could be shaped and deflected; by 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun turns that idea into a controlled instrument: a cathode-ray oscilloscope where an electron beam, steered by electric fields, draws traces on a fluorescent screen in real time. That’s the pivot—images no longer need gears or film. A CRT responds instantly to electrical input, creating a display that can change live. Decades later, this same responsiveness scales into oscilloscopes, experimental television, and radar blips—then into the 1947 CRT Amusement Device, explicitly borrowing radar’s targeting logic.

## Aesthetic, Thematic, and Narrative Lineage
### The glow of war rooms became game language
The CRT’s earliest look isn’t “cartoon”—it’s instrument-panel minimalism. Scientific scopes and WWII radar screens taught a visual grammar of dots, lines, and motion: a sweeping trace, a blip that matters, a screen that feels like an interface. That aesthetic becomes playable when the 1947 CRT Amusement Device turns a radar-like view into a ballistic challenge—players twist knobs to steer a glowing “shell” toward overlay targets, copying the feel of targeting scopes. Later, vector-style displays carry the same DNA: an oscilloscope court in Tennis for Two (1958), crisp line ships and stars in Spacewar! (1962). Even physical screen overlays persist, treating the CRT as an abstract canvas that needs context.

## Genre Codification and Structural Influence
### One screen, many rulesets—shoot, think, rally
CRTs didn’t just display games—they helped stabilize what games could be. The 1947 CRT Amusement Device frames aiming and timing as a repeatable loop: steer a dot “projectile,” commit, watch the outcome against screen targets—an early shooting-game pattern. Once CRTs appear in computing, the screen becomes a stage for rules: OXO (1952) uses a CRT to render a board for turn-based puzzle play, while Tennis for Two (1958) demonstrates real-time sport simulation with dials controlling shot angle. By 1962, Spacewar! locks in an action template—player-vs-player combat, torpedoes, physics—on a vector CRT. Even training systems like SAGE add the idea of selecting targets directly on-screen with a light gun.

## Community, Cultural, and Ecosystem Impact
### Engineers turned instruments into invitations to play
Early CRT interaction lived where CRTs lived: labs, universities, and military projects. That made the first game-like experiments the work of people already fluent in scopes, signals, and knobs. Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr.’s radar and television background feeds directly into the 1947 CRT Amusement Device—war tech reframed as amusement, then kept small because it wasn’t commercialized. In the 1950s, research culture makes play acceptable: Tennis for Two becomes a visitor attraction at a lab, proving a scientific display can entertain. In the 1960s, university “hacker” sharing turns Spacewar! into a traveling idea. Ralph Baer connects the final dot: in 1949 he imagines games on a home television, and by 1966 prototypes the path to the Odyssey.

## Curator's Note
A CRT is not a game—but it is the stage that makes electronic play legible: inputs become visible motion, and motion becomes a challenge. Mechanical amusements contribute the habits of aiming and scoring, science contributes the glowing trace, and wartime systems contribute the tense grammar of targets. When engineers and lab cultures treat the screen as something to interact with—not merely measure—video games become inevitable.

## Highlights
Ralph Baer’s Vision: It’s worth highlighting the foresight of Ralph Baer, who is often called “the father of video games.” In 1949, while designing a television set, Baer suggested building in the ability to play games on the TV – essentially envisioning a home video game console two decades before it became reality. Management rejected the idea at the time, illustrating how unusual the concept was in the 1940s. Baer’s career path demonstrates the slow burn of innovation: he returned to the idea in the 1960s when technology and public mindset had caught up, leading to the first home console (Odyssey, 1972). Baer’s story underscores how the community of TV engineers (many of whom, like Baer, had wartime electronics experience) was crucial in repurposing CRT technology for fun. His initial proposal in 1949 directly shows the influence of ubiquitous CRT-based TVs and perhaps an implicit influence of prior CRT experiments (though Baer wasn’t directly inspired by existing games, the idea of interactive TV was in the air by then).

Debated “First Video Game” Origins: The question of what counts as the “first video game” is a topic of debate among historians, and CRT technology lies at the heart of it. The 1947 CRT amusement device has a strong claim as the earliest electronic game display, but it did not use a computer – it was entirely analog. Some purists exclude it since it wasn’t running code and had no digital memory. Others point to Tennis for Two (1958) as the first true video game since it was designed purely for play (though it, too, was analog in its computing logic). Then there’s Spacewar! (1962), often cited as the first influential digital video game. The lineage from 1897 CRT can be traced through all these, yet none of these would exist without the CRT itself. It’s interesting that Goldsmith’s 1947 device was essentially a dead-end (it “had no effect” on the later video game industry, as it was never marketed or widely known). This indicates that multiple people in different places independently thought to use CRTs for games – a classic example of technology driving innovation once it becomes widespread. By the 1950s, CRT screens were common enough in labs and even homes (as TVs) that using them for games became an idea “whose time had come.”

Cross-pollination of Communities: Another insight is how military, academic, and entertainment communities intersected. The military gave us radar (CRT displays) and the first light guns; academics gave us Spacewar and a culture of sharing programs; the coin-operated amusement industry (rooted in mechanical games) was poised to seize on electronic games once the tech matured (as seen when Nolan Bushnell took Spacewar! as inspiration for the first arcade video game in 1971). The CRT is a common thread through all of these domains, illustrating a rare instance of a technology that was as relevant in a research laboratory or a battlefield as it would be in an arcade or living room. This cross-domain influence helped accelerate video gaming’s development: engineers like Bushnell or Baer, who had one foot in the world of cutting-edge tech and another in popular entertainment, could merge the two because CRT-based displays were a shared platform.
