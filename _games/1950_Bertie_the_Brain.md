## The Game
Bertie the Brain was a publicly exhibited, special-purpose electronic computer game built to play tic-tac-toe (“noughts and crosses”) against a human opponent. Josef Kates is consistently credited as the project’s key designer/architect, while Rogers Majestic is identified as the builder and promoter in surviving company materials. 

The machine is historically notable because it brought an interactive “human vs. computer” game to a large public audience at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto—years before video games became a commercial category. 

Gameplay occurred on a light-based display (no raster “video” screen): the player selected squares using an illuminated 3×3 keypad, while the game state and win indicators were shown with lit symbols and signage. 

A key feature for modern “beat criteria” discussions is that Bertie’s play strength was adjustable: a surviving Rogers Majestic flyer describes multiple “memory and intelligence” levels (including a total of eight), and Kates’ later oral history independently remembered multiple “intelligence levels,” including settings that made the machine effectively unbeatable. 
 
## Gameplay
Bertie the Brain plays standard tic-tac-toe: two sides take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid, and a player wins by completing three marks in a row, column, or diagonal; with optimal play from both sides, the game is a forced draw. A period Rogers Majestic flyer describes Bertie as an electronic “brain” set up to play “Noughts and Crosses,” with the human player inputting moves via a keyboard/keypad and the game state being shown on light-backed panels. The same flyer states the machine alternates who makes the first move (i.e., it can play as either first or second player). 

Kates’ 1992 oral history independently corroborates the basic interface: a large, public-facing tic-tac-toe board “on top for everybody to see,” and a smaller board/keypad “on which you played,” implemented with lights. 

## Modes and Features
No point-score system is described in the primary materials located; instead, the Rogers Majestic flyer’s diagram labels a “scoreboard” area that displays player identity/turn and a win indicator (e.g., “Brain” vs “You,” plus “Win”). 

There is no evidence of lives, health, credits, or continues. Each round ends when a win condition is reached; a draw is the standard terminal outcome in tic-tac-toe if no win occurs before the grid fills, but how Bertie signaled a draw (if at all) is not explicitly described in the flyer and is therefore Unverified for this specific machine. 

The flyer also notes that Bertie’s decision-making could be extremely fast, but that it was sometimes slowed down for demonstration, implying operator control over perceived thinking speed. 

## Level / Progression Structure
Bertie does not have a campaign or staged progression; it is a repeating single-board game. Difficulty progression is instead provided through operator-adjustable play strength:

The Rogers Majestic flyer states “memory and intelligence” are controlled in “levels,” and specifically gives “Bertie has 8 such levels.” 
Kates’ oral history likewise describes “a number of intelligence levels,” noting that at the highest level “you could not beat the machine,” while lower levels could be made beatable. 
The flyer explicitly states “Bertie can be beaten” by reducing the number of levels, and suggests that at the lowest level it may play without a definite plan. 

## How to win
Bertie the Brain is best understood as a round-based game with no overarching finale. A single tic-tac-toe round has a win condition; the overall “experience” loops indefinitely as long as the exhibit operates. Achieve a standard tic-tac-toe victory by being the first side to complete a straight line of three marks (row/column/diagonal) on the 3×3 grid. 

## Development and Historical Context
Surviving documentation frames Bertie the Brain as a computing technology demonstration closely tied to vacuum-tube innovation. In the Rogers Majestic flyer, the machine’s compactness and capability are attributed to a “Binary Adder Tube (BAT)” developed in the company’s laboratories, and the same flyer positions Bertie as a showcase for electronic computing concepts like “memory and intelligence.” 

Technical documentation from Rogers Majestic’s tube division describes the Additron 6047 as a “binary adder tube” intended for high-speed digital computing devices, providing technical context for why a company would build a public demonstration around binary addition hardware. 

Kates’ oral history describes the motive in plain terms: building a game-playing machine for the CNE to publicize the Additron, and being surprised that crowds cared more about the “electronic brain” than the tube itself. He also states the machine ran for long exhibition days (about 12 hours/day) and was “completely electronic” in its logic, with relays mainly used for the lights. 

The Additron concept also appears in Kates’ U.S. patent “Electronic vacuum tube,” issued March 5, 1957 (filed Jan. 1951), showing that the underlying tube technology was treated as a patentable computing component. 

## Legacy and Influence
 Bertie the Brain is frequently discussed in “first video game” and “first computer game” timelines, but its classification depends on definitions—especially whether a light-bulb playfield counts as “video.” Modern institutional discussion of early video-game ancestry emphasizes that multiple late-1940s/early-1950s systems competed as “firsts,” including the Cathode-ray tube amusement device, Nimrod, OXO, and Tennis for Two—with definitional and documentation nuances affecting claims of primacy. 

Within that broader landscape, Bertie’s strongest “legacy hook” is not commercial influence but public demonstration: it presented an interactive human-vs-computer game to a mass audience and introduced the now-familiar idea of adjustable difficulty in an exhibition setting (documented explicitly in contemporary promotional material and in Kates’ own recollections).
