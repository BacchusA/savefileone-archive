## The Game
Developed by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann at DuMont Laboratories (Passaic, NJ). This prototype ran on a custom-built analog circuit and oscilloscope; it was never commercially released, but it holds a unique place in history as the earliest interactive electronic game with a screen. It’s essentially the big bang moment for video games, a laboratory curiosity that proved the concept of video gameplay long before the industry existed. Despite its primitive nature (a single dot simulating a missile), it demonstrated the core idea of player-controlled graphics on a display. This device is often cited in scholarly works as a forerunner of video games. It didn’t influence its contemporaries (since it wasn’t public) but was way ahead of its time, prefiguring the basic concept of a video game.
