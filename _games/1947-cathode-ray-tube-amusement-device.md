## Exhibit Placard
Developed by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann at DuMont Laboratories (Passaic, NJ). This prototype ran on a custom-built analog circuit and oscilloscope; it was never commercially released, but it holds a unique place in history as the earliest interactive electronic game with a screen. In this episode, we’ll highlight why it matters: It’s essentially the big bang moment for video games – a laboratory curiosity that proved the concept of video gameplay long before the industry existed. Despite its primitive nature (a single dot simulating a missile), it demonstrated the core idea of player-controlled graphics on a display. Why it matters: Every video game today, from Pong to modern console titles, traces back to this humble device that turned wartime tech into play. It’s a testament to human creativity that even with 1940s technology, the urge to make a “game” out of it was there.

## Historical Significance
This device is often cited in scholarly works as a forerunner of video games. It didn’t influence its contemporaries (since it wasn’t public) but was way ahead of its time, prefiguring the basic concept of a video game. We’ll pitch it to the audience as “the first game that nobody knew about”, an ancestor of all gaming that remained in obscurity until historians uncovered it decades later. The episode will underline that, even though it’s not a “video game” by strict definitions (no digital computer), it absolutely is part of gaming history – the first instance of interactive graphics, predating the likes of Tennis for Two and Spacewar! by a decade or more.

## Core Design Influences
The Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device borrows its feel from wartime technology, not toys. Its inventors explicitly looked to World War II radar scopes and missile control displays: the player doesn’t “move a character,” they steer a glowing dot like guided ordnance, lining up a target the way an operator might track an aircraft. It also inherits the older promise of mechanical shooting amusements—hit the moving target, win the moment—while swapping wood, lamps, and sensors for a cathode-ray tube. That translation is the leap: a shooting-gallery challenge re-staged on an electronic screen, with player control at the center.

## Technical Innovations
This prototype turns a cathode-ray tube into a playable display: a moving dot becomes the entire “sprite sheet.” With no digital computer, it simulates ballistics through analog electronics—vacuum tubes, capacitors, oscillators—pushing the electron beam along a parabolic arc to mimic gravity. A timing circuit deliberately defocuses the dot at the end of flight, creating a fuzzy “explosion” like a time fuse. Visuals arrive via transparent screen overlays with painted targets; “collision” is judged by whether the dot overlaps the target at the blast moment, described in the patent as being within target coordinates when triggered. And crucially: Goldsmith and Mann secured an early patent for an electronic game device, detailing circuitry and rules.

## Aesthetic, Thematic, and Narrative Lineage
Its “art direction” is pure 1940s: radar-scope minimalism and anti-aircraft intent. The target imagery—airplanes painted on transparent overlays—frames the implied story: fire an artillery shell, catch the aircraft in your blast. The screen itself carries the aesthetic: a circular CRT face and oscilloscope-style glow born from television-lab hardware culture. There are no characters and no plot, but the tone is unmistakable: scientific demonstration turned amusement, with a military silhouette hovering behind every control knob. The breakdown also places it in a broader post-war imagination—futuristic gadgets becoming leisure devices—where the boundary between instrument and toy starts to blur.

## Genre Codification and Structural Influence
Retroactively, historians read this device as a forerunner to “shooter” and “artillery” thinking: adjust trajectory, fire, and let timing decide the outcome. The structure is stark—no levels, no score counter, no progression loop—just the binary drama of hit or miss. Yet it introduces recognizably game-like constraints: the shell must “explode” near the target within a set time, and the player can increase challenge by choosing a less direct path. Its aim-at-airplanes premise has been likened to distant descendants like Space Invaders and Galaxian, not as a direct lineage, but as an early proof that screen action plus player input can create a new kind of skill contest.

## Community, Cultural, and Ecosystem Impact
In 1947, this was not a public game—it was a lab prototype with no arcade crowd, no living-room audience, and no community at all. Built and tested in a research setting at DuMont, it exemplifies the earliest “game dev studio”: scientists repurposing serious equipment for play. Because it was never marketed, it had no immediate industry impact; later pioneers weren’t aware of it, and the patent faded from view. Its influence arrives late, through rediscovery: historians and hobbyists unearthed the patent in the early 2000s, and it later surfaced as prior-art context (including mention in connection with a 1974 Magnavox lawsuit). Goldsmith preserved and demonstrated the prototype decades later, shifting its role from product to educational artifact.

## Curator's Note
The Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device reads like a hinge in history: military display logic becomes a game loop, and laboratory circuitry becomes a player’s tool. Its aesthetics, mechanics, and structure are minimal because the technology is minimal—yet the idea is expansive: an electronic screen can host rules, timing, and skill. The legacy isn’t a direct family tree; it’s a recovered blueprint that proves the medium’s roots run deeper than the marketplace ever saw.

## Highlights
Developer Trajectory: It’s worth noting (perhaps in narration or a sidebar) that Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. never became a “game developer” in the modern sense. After this invention, he continued in electronics and became a physics professor, not joining the later video game industry. This highlights how the idea of a game designer career didn’t exist yet – Goldsmith’s story shows that the people behind the first games were engineers and scientists experimenting outside their main jobs. It might be a neat “where are they now?” footnote for the audience: the inventor of the first game lived to see video games become a huge industry by the 2000s (Goldsmith lived until 2009, age 99) and gave a few interviews late in life, but he built only this one game device.

Debated Lineage: We can briefly mention the ongoing debate about “what counts as the first video game?” Some historians argue for this device, others point to later projects depending on definitions. It’s an interesting nuance: the CRT device was unknown for so long that for decades people thought 1958’s Tennis for Two or 1962’s Spacewar! was the first. By including this point, we inform viewers that the lineage of video games has been reconstructed over time, and that our series is covering even those forgotten contenders. This could be a quick voiceover segment like: “By the way, you won’t find this game in old record books – it wasn’t until the 21st century that gaming historians acknowledged it, adjusting the family tree of games to put this as generation zero.”

Speculative Influences: Given its obscurity, the CRT device likely didn’t inspire those who came after, but it’s still fun to draw comparisons. We might note, for instance, “If you’ve ever played an artillery-style video game or aimed a slingshot in Angry Birds, the basic concept of arcing a shot to hit a target can trace its heritage back to this 1947 experiment.” While not a direct influence, it shows how certain gameplay ideas emerge repeatedly. Also, the use of screen overlays here prefigured the design of the Magnavox Odyssey – interestingly, in the Odyssey’s 1974 patent legal defense, they brought up Goldsmith’s patent as prior art. Such trivia could be included if time permits, to show that sometimes ideas resurface independently.
