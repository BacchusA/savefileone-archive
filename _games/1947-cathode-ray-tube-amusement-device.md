## Exhibit Placard
Developed by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann at DuMont Laboratories (Passaic, NJ). This prototype ran on a custom-built analog circuit and oscilloscope; it was never commercially released, but it holds a unique place in history as the earliest interactive electronic game with a screen. Here, we’ll highlight why it matters: It’s essentially the big bang moment for video games, a laboratory curiosity that proved the concept of video gameplay long before the industry existed. Despite its primitive nature (a single dot simulating a missile), it demonstrated the core idea of player-controlled graphics on a display. Why it matters: Every video game today, from Pong to modern console titles, traces back to this humble device that turned wartime tech into play. It’s a testament to human creativity that even with 1940s technology, the urge to make a “game” out of it was there.

## Historical Significance
This device is often cited in scholarly works as a forerunner of video games. It didn’t influence its contemporaries (since it wasn’t public) but was way ahead of its time, prefiguring the basic concept of a video game. We’ll pitch it to the audience as “the first game that nobody knew about”, an ancestor of all gaming that remained in obscurity until historians uncovered it decades later. The episode will underline that, even though it’s not a “video game” by strict definitions (no digital computer), it absolutely is part of gaming history – the first instance of interactive graphics, predating the likes of Tennis for Two and Spacewar! by a decade or more.

## Core Design Influences
### Radar thinking turns aiming into a playable skill
The Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device didn’t borrow from “games” so much as from wartime screens. Its central action, steering a glowing dot like an artillery shell, mirrors the mental workflow of radar operators and missile-control systems: adjust, predict, commit, watch the result. It also inherits the arcade promise of mechanical shooting galleries like Seeburg’s Ray-O-Lite: a target, a shot, and the satisfaction of a hit. The leap is translation. Instead of painted targets and light sensors, the challenge moves onto a CRT/oscilloscope display, turning a lab instrument into a player-facing arena.

## Technical Innovations
### Analog circuits fake physics on a glowing tube
This prototype treats electronics as both display and simulator. A cathode-ray tube shows a moving dot, an electronic visual output harnessed for play, not measurement. With no digital computer, analog components shape the “ballistics”: the electron beam bends into a parabolic arc, approximating gravity in circuitry. A timing circuit ends the flight with a deliberate defocus—an explosion effect created by controlled fuzzing rather than sprites. Because the CRT can’t draw targets, transparent overlays provide airplanes, and “collision” is judged by whether the dot overlaps the painted shape at the moment of detonation. The patent’s existence matters too: it formalizes circuitry and rules as a blueprint for electronic games.

## Aesthetic, Thematic, and Narrative Lineage
### Military overlays and oscilloscope glow set the mood
Its theme is blunt and era-specific: shoot down aircraft, framed through WWII imagery and the language of targeting. The narrative isn’t spoken; it’s implied by the overlay drawings and the act of guiding a projectile toward an enemy silhouette. Visually, the device carries the look of its birthplace, a television research lab, through the circular CRT face and the scientific “instrument” vibe. The style is minimalism by necessity: a single moving point, an explosion blur, and whatever the transparent overlay can suggest. That stripped-down display becomes a quiet ancestor to later minimalist screen games, where meaning comes from motion and rules rather than detail.

## Genre Codification and Structural Influence
### Aiming, timing, and control mastery—genre seeds
Seen through a modern lens, this is a proto-shooter and proto-artillery game: adjust trajectory, fire, and hope your timing puts the “explosion” where the target is. The structure is pure skill test—no score counter, no levels, no progression—just repeated attempts to master the knobs and predict motion. It also introduces a built-in constraint: a time-limited flight that forces commitment and consequence. The device didn’t define genres in its own time because it was never released, but its mechanical core maps cleanly onto later aiming-and-firing formats, from shooting galleries to artillery strategy. The important template isn’t content—it’s interaction: real-time input shaping a visible outcome.

## Community, Cultural, and Ecosystem Impact
### Forgotten prototype—rediscovered later as prior art
In 1947, this device had no audience. It was a lab-built prototype, unmarketed and essentially invisible to the public, no arcade floor, no home release, no community around it. Its cultural footprint comes from its context: post-war experimentation, where physicists repurposed electronics for playful ends, foreshadowing later lab-born games like oscilloscope experiments and early computer demos. But there’s no direct mentorship chain, later pioneers weren’t aware of it, and the patent slipped into obscurity. The impact arrives decades later through rediscovery: historians and hobbyists elevate it as an early milestone, and its patent appears in legal contexts as evidence of early electronic game concepts.

## Curator's Note
This machine is a bridge: wartime screen logic and lab hardware repurposed into play. Its legacy isn’t a direct lineage of designers copying it, but a conceptual proof—interactive visuals, simulated motion, and player-controlled outcomes, waiting decades to be recognized. The device’s story reminds us that games didn’t “arrive” fully formed; they emerged wherever technology and curiosity briefly overlapped.

## Highlights
Developer Trajectory: It’s worth noting (perhaps in narration or a sidebar) that Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. never became a “game developer” in the modern sense. After this invention, he continued in electronics and became a physics professor, not joining the later video game industry. This highlights how the idea of a game designer career didn’t exist yet – Goldsmith’s story shows that the people behind the first games were engineers and scientists experimenting outside their main jobs. It might be a neat “where are they now?” footnote for the audience: the inventor of the first game lived to see video games become a huge industry by the 2000s (Goldsmith lived until 2009, age 99) and gave a few interviews late in life, but he built only this one game device.

Debated Lineage: We can briefly mention the ongoing debate about “what counts as the first video game?” Some historians argue for this device, others point to later projects depending on definitions. It’s an interesting nuance: the CRT device was unknown for so long that for decades people thought 1958’s Tennis for Two or 1962’s Spacewar! was the first. By including this point, we inform viewers that the lineage of video games has been reconstructed over time, and that our series is covering even those forgotten contenders. This could be a quick voiceover segment like: “By the way, you won’t find this game in old record books, it wasn’t until the 21st century that gaming historians acknowledged it, adjusting the family tree of games to put this as generation zero.”

Speculative Influences: Given its obscurity, the CRT device likely didn’t inspire those who came after, but it’s still fun to draw comparisons. We might note, for instance, “If you’ve ever played an artillery-style video game or aimed a slingshot in Angry Birds, the basic concept of arcing a shot to hit a target can trace its heritage back to this 1947 experiment.” While not a direct influence, it shows how certain gameplay ideas emerge repeatedly. Also, the use of screen overlays here prefigured the design of the Magnavox Odyssey, interestingly, in the Odyssey’s 1974 patent legal defense, they brought up Goldsmith’s patent as prior art. Such trivia could be included if time permits, to show that sometimes ideas resurface independently.
