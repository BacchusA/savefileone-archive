## The Game
The Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device is an early, patent-documented concept for an interactive electronic “shooting/hurling” style game built around a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display and player-adjustable controls. 
 It is described as a skill-based game in which the player manipulates the CRT beam’s trace/position so that an automatically moving “projectile” trace reaches a physical target image placed on the face of the tube. 
 When the “projectile” reaches the target area, the device describes creating a visible “explosion” effect by defocusing the beam at a chosen point, visually simulating a detonation or destruction of the target (for example, an airplane). 

In video game history writing, it is frequently treated as a notably early, well-documented predecessor to later screen-based games—especially because it involves player interaction with a visual electronic display—but it was not marketed broadly and is not universally labeled “the first video game,” depending on definitions of “video” and how essential raster video signals are to that definition. 
 One recurring point in the “is it a video game?” debate is that oscilloscopes/CRTs can display traces without using a raster video signal; some historical definitions of “video” emphasize raster scanning and pixel-like image formation. 
 
## Gameplay
Core objective (moment-to-moment loop). The patent describes placing “one or more targets” (example given: pictures of airplanes) on the face of the CRT, and the player’s objective is to deflect the beam’s trace so it reaches a selected target and becomes defocused at that moment—simulating an explosion/destruction effect on the target. 
 The beam’s trace is described as being automatically caused to move across the face of the tube, with the path intentionally set to depart from a straight line to increase skill requirements. 

Controls and player actions. The patent explicitly describes a cabinet-mounted presentation (“face of the tube visible through an opening in the front panel”) and lists multiple knobs/buttons associated with operating the device: a control to open/close the firing switch that causes the trace to appear, controls that affect the direction/trajectory of the trace from its starting point, and controls that determine when/where the beam becomes defocused (“explodes”). 
 In practical player terms: set up a target overlay, adjust trajectory controls, “fire” to produce a visible trace, and attempt to time/shape the trace so the defocus/explosion coincides with the target region. 

Projectile motion and “explosion” effect. The trace is described as parabolic under the described deflection system, and the “explosion” is implemented by driving the beam significantly out of focus, producing a larger, rounder spot than a sharply focused point. 

Scoring rules. No scoring system, score display, or point-award method is described in the cited patent passages; the device is framed as a skill game centered on hitting targets and producing a visible explosion effect. 

Lives/health, time limits, continues, difficulty. No lives/health/continue structure is specified in the patent description. 
 However, the patent indicates the motion can be periodic and that repetition rate can be varied, implying adjustable pacing and difficulty through control settings rather than through discrete “lives” or levels. 

Power-ups/items/enemies/hazards. The “targets” are physical images placed on the CRT face (examples include airplanes), rather than electronically generated enemies; no electronic enemy behaviors or item systems are described. 

## Modes and Features
Players / multiplayer. The patent text describes a single player (“the player”) using the controls to manipulate the beam trace toward targets; no alternating or simultaneous multiplayer rules are described. 

Difficulty and variants. Difficulty is primarily framed as skill-based: the patent states the path is preferably set to depart from a straight line specifically to require more skill and care, and it characterizes the device as a game where skill increases with practice. 
 The ability to vary the repetition rate of the beam’s movement also suggests adjustable challenge/pacing via control settings. 

Cabinet/operator settings. The patent mentions placement in a cabinet with front-panel-mounted controls, but it does not describe coin operation, DIP switches, or operator manuals typical of later commercial arcade machines. 

## Level / Progression Structure
Stages/boards/rounds. No finite stage count, campaign structure, or defined “last level” is described. 
 The gameplay loop is better understood as repeatable shot attempts—each attempt consisting of setting controls and firing a trace—rather than progression through discrete levels. 

Progression mechanics. There is no described internal progression (unlocking, increasing wave difficulty, etc.) beyond the player improving at controlling the trace and timing the defocus/explosion through practice. 

Checkpoints / save system / continues. No save, checkpoint, or continue system is described; this is consistent with a hardware skill device rather than a software state-based game. 

## How to win
No official “end state” (credits, completion screen, final stage clear, or terminal score condition) is described in the patent text. 
 Instead, the closest thing to a formally described success condition is hitting a target: the object is to deflect the beam so it strikes a selected target image and becomes defocused at that point, simulating destruction/explosion. 

What the player sees when they “win” (per attempt). The patent describes making the game more “spectacular” by producing a visible explosion effect when the target is hit, and describes the explosion effect as the beam becoming significantly out of focus (a larger, dimmer spot vs. a sharp trace). 

## Development and Historical Context
Technical framing in the patent. The patent describes the device as a CRT-based amusement game using electronic circuitry and physical player controls, emphasizing skill, a non-straight projectile path (parabolic trace), and a defocus-based “explosion” effect to make a hit visually apparent. 
 It also explicitly situates the device as something that can be mounted in a cabinet with controls on the front panel, suggesting a presentation style that resembles later amusement machines even if the device is not documented as a coin-operated commercial product. 

Was a prototype built? Evidence conflict. Some secondary histories explicitly state that no actual prototype was ever built, implying the idea remained a patent-level concept. 
 Conversely, later reporting includes an anecdotal recollection that Goldsmith demonstrated the device to a colleague (Bill Brantley), implying a working unit existed at least at some point. 
 Given that the patent itself does not prove a manufactured unit and no widely verified surviving hardware is established in these sources, the most defensible wiki stance is: the existence of a working prototype is plausible but not conclusively verified from the patent record alone, and published secondary sources disagree. 

Context among early electronic games. Institutional history writing (e.g., 
) places it as an early predecessor in a lineage that includes later public demonstrations and computer/oscilloscope games such as 
, while also noting definitional issues around what qualifies as a “video” game. 

## Legacy and Influence
The device is regularly cited as an unusually early, well-documented example of player interaction with an electronic display, because it is preserved in an accessible patent record with explicit gameplay intent (targets, player controls, hit/explosion effect). 
 At the same time, multiple historical narratives emphasize limited real-world exposure/marketing for such early devices, framing them as curiosities or engineering experiments rather than mass-market entertainment products. 

In modern “first video game” discussions, it is often invoked to illustrate why the answer depends on definitions: some arguments focus on the presence of interactive screen visuals (which it clearly has), while others insist on a raster video signal or software execution as requirements for “video game” status. 
 In practice, its importance to a public-facing reference project is less about crowning it “the first” and more about documenting a concrete, dated milestone showing that interactive, screen-based electronic play concepts existed in the late 1940s.
