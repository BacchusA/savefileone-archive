## Exhibit Placard
A handmade 1947 prototype that treated a CRT screen like a target range. Players used knobs to adjust a moving dot (the “projectile”) to simulate an arcing shot toward targets—often described as overlays placed on the screen. It was patented, never commercialized, and still matters because it’s the earliest-known interactive electronic game concept built around an electronic display.

## Mechanics Snapshot
- Controls: knobs (trajectory adjustment)
- Objective: “hit” the target overlay with the CRT dot path
- Skill focus: timing + adjustment + prediction
